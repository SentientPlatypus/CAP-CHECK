Okay im doing a hackathon rn, entertainment/media theme, here is our idea, CapCheck. 
for debates, lots of time, debators lie or slip up, saying incorect info. 
this is a glorified fact checker. hardware+software.
 we have a central computer, connected to a button and arduino, 
 connected to 2 more arduinos, each on a debator. the debator arduinos 
 each have a light and a mic/headset. So during the debate, if one guy 
 thinks the other guy lied, he can slam the cap check button, which pauses the debate.
  during the debate, the headsets through arduino streams to the computer,
   which keeps a log of the transcript, and we use google gemeni to track 
   the latest thing said, and use their API to factcheck, then the computer's 
   frontend will display the factcheck, and say the actual info, and if he lied,
    and if lied, then the red light on the arduino will shine red like pinochio.
     we plan to use flask backend, react tailwind front end,
